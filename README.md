## About Armors's_SecretFinder

Armor's_SecretFinder is a Python script based on SecretFinder original script. I have updated most of the regex searches in the JavaScript file to reduce false positives. Additionally, I've included a few more API searches that were not part of the original SecretFinder script.

I will be writing a blog about these enhancements soon. You can find it at: https://securearmors.com/blog

## About SecretFinder ( also the Reference to original script)

SecretFinder is a python script based on [LinkFinder](https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder), written to discover sensitive data like apikeys, accesstoken, authorizations, jwt,..etc in JavaScript files. It does so by using jsbeautifier for python in combination with a fairly large regular expression. The regular expressions consists of four small regular expressions. These are responsible for finding and search anything on js files.
